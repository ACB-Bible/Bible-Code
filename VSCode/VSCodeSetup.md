##### Setup the LiveServer Debugger
1. Click on the VSCode gear icon in the lower left hand corner of the VSCode editor to open settings. Search for and edit the "liveServer.settings.chromeDebuggingAttachment" property and set it to true. This enables the Chrome debugger attachment feature.

```json
"liveServer.settings.ChromeDebuggingAttachment": true
```

2. Create a .vscode folder in your project's top level folder, then create a launch.json file in the .vscode folder. Edit the launch.json file with the following configurations for localhost and Nodejs. Save the launch.json file and start LiveServer by clicking on the **Go Live** button at the bottom right hand corner of the VSCode editor.

```json
// Copy and paste this code to your lounch.json file

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
